## Subscriptions

Run the following command to log in to your Azure account:
```bash
az login
# this will open a tab in you browser then pick you account

az config set core.allow_broker=true
az account clear
az login
```

Once logged in, you'll see a JSON output with a list of your available subscriptions, including their names and IDs. Find the subscription ID corresponding to "Azure Subscription 1".
```json
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "id": "xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx", 
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Azure subscription 1",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "user": {
      "name": "example@gmail.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  },
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "id": "xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "isDefault": false,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Test Subscription",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "user": {
      "name": "example@gmail.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

Set the active subscription to "Azure Subscription 1" by running the following command (replace <subscription_id> with the actual subscription ID you found in step 3):

```bash
az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
az account set --subscription xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx
```

Now, all subsequent Azure CLI commands will use "Azure Subscription 1" as the active subscription.

To verify that the correct subscription is active, you can run:

```bash
az account show
# json will validate your account
```
## Resource Groups

List all Resource Group
```
az group list --output table
```

Delete Resource Group
```
az group delete -n $rg
```

script that deletes all resources group
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the list of resource group names
resource_groups=$(az group list --query "[].name" -o tsv)

# Loop through the resource groups and delete each one
for rg in $resource_groups; do
  echo "Deleting resource group: $rg"
  az group delete --name $rg --yes --no-wait
done

echo "All resource groups have been queued for deletion."

```
